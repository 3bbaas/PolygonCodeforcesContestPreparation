    The little boy got furious and told them that Palestine is an Arabian country and that it is wrongfully invaded and should be free from any invasion.


    The men apologized to 7anzla and asked him if there was a way they could help spread the word. The boy told them that if anyone says ''Free_Palestine!" to tell them \bf{''Free_Palestine!"} and do the same if they said \bf{''Palestine_is_an_Arab_country!''

    Can you help 7anzla make a program that does what he wants?

\input

    The first and only line contains one string $S$ $(1 \le S \le 100)$ which consists of \bf{Latin} characters separated by \bf{underscores} $(\_)$

\output

    If \bf{7anzla} agrees with what's being said, output \bf{''Free_Palestine!"} \tiny{(without the quotes)}. If he doesn't agree, output \bf{''You_are_wrong!_Palestine_is_an_Arab_country!''} \tiny{(without the quotes)}

\Notes
